PHP pizza website using CodeIgniter
used WAMP server to run it in the browser.  I did this in a PHP class but wanted to try using CodeIgniter.  I had to learn it on my own and learned a lot about finding information on the web.

You can log in and get delivery information and for delivered pizza, and if authorized get into the list of employees.  I used SQL to create the tables.
