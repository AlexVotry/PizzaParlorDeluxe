application/config.php:
	setting base_url
	$config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost/pizzaCode/'; 
 	if I change the the name, I need to change this on

database.php within codeigniter\application\config.
	change data base to database being used.

	$user_list is adminList
	$u_key is adKey
	database users is admins

Moved starting point to home.php by going to route.php and changing default from welcome to home

	showHome -> showCustForm -> showSummary.

	* total with tax is different on showHome and showCustForm.
	* showHome writes Large twice
	* contact needs a page.
